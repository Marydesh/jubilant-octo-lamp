* This app is generates a README file by using a command-line application.

* The generated README file includes what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions and the section with a developer's contact information.

- I used two Node.js modules: inquirer and fs to create prompts for user input, and the to work with files and directories in the Node.js app.

- Created functions to generate table of contents for README and to fill in each section with the prompt data(answers), function to get and display the license badge.

- This app can be used to easily generate the quality readme file.
